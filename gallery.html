                <h2>Lamb, Manuka and Potato Fondant Bite</h2>
                <p>This dish features medium-rare lamb with a savory, seared crust. Underneath, a crispy, golden potato
                    with a soft, buttery interior is drizzled with a rich Manuka honey sauce. Together, these elements
                    create a balanced and flavorful canapé.</p>

                <h2>Beef and Kumara Empanada</h2>
                <p>My dish is empanadas. I experimented with different types of flour—self-raising, high grade, and
                    wholemeal. For my indigenous ingredient, I used kumara</p>

                <h2>Tarakihi Ceviche</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This is my take on the South American dish ceviche. In this unit, we had to incorporate an indigenous
                    ingredient, and I decided to use our local seafood, tarakihi.</p>

                <h2>Cheese Turnover</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This dish is perfect for those seeking convenience and flavor. It offers a quick and easy meal with
                    minimal effort. The combination of cheese, sauce, and your favorite toppings wrapped in a crispy,
                    handheld package makes it ideal for busy days or when you need a tasty snack.</p>

                <h2>Eye Fillet and Caramelised Onion Cracker</h2>
                <p>In this unit, we tested ingredient properties and focused on using indigenous ingredients. My dish
                    features an eye fillet and caramelized onion cracker. I experimented with different flours and
                    settled on wholemeal flour, while Manuka honey is incorporated into the mascarpone.</p>

                <h2>Salmon Blini with Kawakawa Cream</h2>
                <br>
                <p>For this finger food, I made a self-rising flour blini topped with kawakawa cream and Manuka-smoked
                    salmon. This was part of an assessment where we had to incorporate a traditional ingredient—I chose
                    kawakawa and Manuka-smoked salmon.</p>

                <h2>Bruschetta with Kawakawa Crostini</h2>
                <br>
                <p>My dish is bruschetta with kawakawa crostini. We were required to use a New Zealand indigenous
                    ingredient, so I added kawakawa to my bread dough. After experimenting with different types of
                    flour, my stakeholders agreed that self-raising flour worked the best.</p>

                <h2>Honey Soy Chicken on Crispy Rice</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This canapé features a crispy, golden-brown rice base topped with pieces of honey soy chicken, coated
                    in a rich, sweet, and tangy sauce. Garnished with toasted sesame seeds and spring onions, this dish
                    is colorful and delicious.</p>
